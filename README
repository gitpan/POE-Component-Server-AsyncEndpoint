POE::Component::Server::AsyncEndpoint version 0.01
==================================================

DESCRIPTION

This module implements an asynchronous endpoint server to help deploy
asynchronous web services in SOA architectures. Even though it may
resemble many features of the so-called Enterprise Service Bus, it is
actually the opposite of an ESB in the sense it does not try to
centralize on "a" bus but rather in a decentralized fashion. 

Please read the POD documentation for a more thorough description.

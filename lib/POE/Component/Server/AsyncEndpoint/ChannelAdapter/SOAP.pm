=head1 NAME

package POE::Component::Server::AsyncEndpoint::ChannelAdapter::SOAP;

=head1 SYNOPSIS

When you init your Endpoint:

        my $soc = POE::Component::Server::AsyncEndpoint::ChannelAdapter::SOAP->spawn({
            proxy   => $self->{config}->soap_proxy,
            service => $self->{config}->soap_service,
        });

        # $self->{config}->soap_proxy is defined in your config file
        # and usually has something like: 'http://yourserver.yourdomain/webservices.php'

        # $self->{config}->soap_service is defined in your config file
        # and usually has something like: 'http://yourserver.yourdomain/soapservices.wsdl'

Later in your Endpoint:

        # make a SOAP call as if it were local
        my $call = $soc->yourSOAPCall(
            $self->{config}->socuser,
            $self->{config}->socpass
        );

        unless ( $call->fault ) {

        ...


=head1 DESCRIPTION

At the moment, this class is basically a wrapper around SOAP::Lite
and should eventually simplify you interaction with SOAP in future
versions.

=head2 Methods


=over 4

=item spawn

This sole method requires two parameters: B<proxy>, which should contain
a valid URL to your SOAP server, and B<service>, which should point to a
URL where the WSDL file can be fetched.
